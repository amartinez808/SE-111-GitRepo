        <!-- Example of embedding JavaScript within the HTML page: typically for small, self-contained code.  Not best for re-usability-->
        <!-- To start using JS in the middle of HTML, use the <script> tag  -->
        <script>

            //Notice the change in how we write comments within JS

            //Turns on strict mode, which states we will use some proper coding practices, like using keywords when declaring vars
            "use strict";   //Recommended to always use this.  JavaScript, even under strict mode, allows many unorthodox coding practices

            //get miles driven from the user - my preferred way - keeps each action separate - easier to troubleshoot
            let tMiles = prompt("Enter miles driven");
            const miles = parseInt(tMiles);

            //get gallons used from user - considered elegant sometimes because this code does the same as above, but with one line of code.
            // Takes longer for someone to read/interpret AND harder to troubleshoot as is when there is an issue within this code.
            const gallons = parseInt(prompt("Enter gallons of gas used"));

            //calculate mpg - runs fine without the parseFloat function, but here because numeric variables/constants are not locked 
            // into float or int
            const mpg = parseFloat(miles / gallons);

            //Creating output string via concatenation and tamplate literals that allow evaluation of ${variables} within literal strings
            // Notices that these are neither single nor double quotes.  They are apostrophes (Usually the key to the left of the '1' key)
            // This key also has '~' on it when the 'shift' key is pressed.
